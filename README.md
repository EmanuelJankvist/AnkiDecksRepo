Anki is a flashcard-software, which utilizes active recall/spaced repition.
This repository consists of .apkg-files, which contain anki-flashcards.
These cards are made using the LaTeX-typesetting system, such that mathematical expressions can be typeset accurately.
For further descriptions consult the _further notes_ section.

This material shouldn't be used without understanding the underlying mathematical proofs/arguments/context (using the sources).
All of the provided .apkg-files have cards in _excess_. It's important not to use _all_ provided cards (selection is important).


**Some further notes on technicalities**

This section is incomplete as of yet.
